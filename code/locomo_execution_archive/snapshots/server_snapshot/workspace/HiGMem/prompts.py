CREATE_AND_LINK_TURN_PROMPT = """
You are a dialogue analyst and knowledge graph architect. Your task is to process a "Current Turn" by analyzing its content, identifying key entities, and linking it to the "Recent History".
## Core Instructions:
1.  **Analyze Content**: Generate `keywords`, a `context` summary, and `tags` for the "Current Turn".
2.  **Identify Specific Entities for Profile Retrieval**: From the "Current Turn", extract all **specific, identifiable entities** whose profiles would be relevant for understanding this turn's context.
    - An entity MUST be a **Named Entity** (e.g., 'Liora', 'Marek', 'Harborvale', 'Nimbo') OR a **Specifically Owned Entity** (e.g., 'Liora's students', 'Marek's partner').
    - Do NOT extract generic common nouns like 'friends', 'kids', 'family', or abstract concepts like 'mental health'.
3.  **Identify Conversational Links**: Determine if the "Current Turn" has a direct conversational relationship (e.g., question-answer) with any turn in the "Recent History".

UPDATE_EVENT_PROMPT = """
You are a meticulous archivist. Your task is to update an event summary and its fact sheet by integrating a new dialogue turn.
## Core Instructions:
1.  **Analyze Context**: Understand the "New Turn" in the context of the "Recent Dialogue Turns" that preceded it.
2.  **Identify Specific Entities**: From the "New Turn" and its context, list all key entities involved for whom a personal profile might be created.

You are a memory organization agent. Your task is to determine the event affiliation for a "New Turn". A turn can belong to one or more existing events, or be the start of a new one.

- Last Updated Event Summary: {last_event_summary}

## Candidate Events (Top-{k} most similar events):

## New Turn:

1.  Analyze the "New Turn" in the context of the character's history and recent conversations.
2.  Compare its content and topic with each "Candidate Event".
3.  Decide which event(s) it belongs to. It's possible for a turn to bridge two topics, thus belonging to multiple events.

You are a helpful research assistant. Your task is to judge if the following memory items are helpful for answering the question.

## Core Instructions:
1.  **Analyze Question**: Identify the main subject(s) (person, pet, entity), the core action/topic, and any temporal constraints (e.g., 'after the workshop', 'in early spring') from the "Question".
2.  **Primary Filter (Subject Check)**: A memory item is **highly relevant** if its main subject matches the question's subject.
3.  **Secondary Filter (Context Check)**: If the subject doesn't directly match, consider if the item provides crucial context to the question's topic. For example, if the question is about 'Liora's feelings', a memory of 'Marek encouraging Liora' is relevant even if Marek is the speaker.
4.  **Be Inclusive, Not Strict**: Your goal is to provide all potentially useful clues. When in doubt, lean towards including the memory item. Do not discard a memory just because one aspect (e.g., time) doesn't perfectly match, if other aspects are highly relevant.
